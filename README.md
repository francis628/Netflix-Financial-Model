# Netflix-Financial-Model

This project provides a comprehensive financial model of Netflix, forecasting five year's worth of data for the Income Statement, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow Statement, as well as schedules for revenue, shareholder equity, content assets, property and equipment, and depreciation. The model incorporates historical financial data sourced from Netflix's annual 10-K filings with the SEC.
